# 👋 Hi, I'm David Hopkins II

**Operations Analyst | Data Enthusiast | Logistics & Compliance Specialist**

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a data-driven operations professional with 10+ years of experience in logistics, compliance, and supply chain management—currently transitioning into business intelligence and analytics.

From optimizing warehouse systems to building KPI dashboards that improve tracking accuracy by 40%, I’ve consistently used data to solve real-world challenges. My journey into analytics began with a childhood obsession for simulation games like *Theme Park Tycoon*, where I learned to dive deep into systems, spot patterns, and make strategic decisions—skills I’ve carried into my career.
